## Codeacademy Sass challenges

These is a repository for my solutions for the [Codeacademy Sass challenges](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sass "Learn Sass").
Please note that these challenges run in an own framework. To compile SCSS to CSS you need to install Ruby using Linux or Windows whre your code can be compiled using the terminal.

Also note that index.html files are incomplete; Codeacademy puts the code automatically in the body part according to this:
```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>

THERE GOES THE CODE

</body>
</html>
```
